# Project1_HTML_CSS

               This site, created using only HTML and CSS, was inspired by my previous 
            work as an elementary teacher.  I created something I might have used 
            in my classroom to motivate my students about a new topic or to use as a 
            resource for student research.  This was my final project for the 
            course that first exposed me to the concept of writing code.
